The user database consists of one table: administrators.
Email and password is saved as text. To safely store passwords, hashing should be used.
This is not implemented due to this being an MVP and development constraints.

There is no data type for handling dates specifically in SQLite.
Instead the TEXT type is used with the following format: yyyy-mm-dd
This is to allow an easier conversion to a date-object in Java.

Three basic users are provided as dummy data for testing.
