The user database consists of one table: administrators.
Email and password is saved as text. To safely store passwords, hashing should be used.

There is no data type for handling dates specifically in SQLite.
Instead an Integer is used in the following format: yyyymmdd

The year is first because the first decimal of an integer cannot be 0,
which could be the case for months and days, if you want a consistent length.
